1. Implement na√Øve bayes classification model. For evaluation of the model, you are expected to use k-cross validation and F1 score. 
	

		
	a. Get the f1 scores for the dataset.
	b. Use filter feature selection technique (Bidirectional Search) and get the the f1 scores.
	c. Use wrapper feature selection technique (Bidirectional Search) and get the f1 scores.
	d. Use PCA technique using a data mining tool and get the the f1 scores.
	e. Use LDA technique using a data mining tool and get the the f1 scores.
	f. Compare your results.
		1. Which technique has given better results in terms of f1 score? (filter feature selection or wrapper feature selection) Was it expected?
		2. Which technique has given better results in terms of f1 score? (PCA or LDA)? Was it expected?
		3. Have the filter feature selection and wrapper feature selection technique given similar set of features? Which attributes are different?
		4. Which technique has given better results? (feature selection or dimention reduction)? Was it expected?
		
			
2. Prepare a report for the answers to the questions.
