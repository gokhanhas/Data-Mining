1. Implement DB-Scan model. You must use the algorithm mentioned in the book. You can use any programming language. Find a dataset to present the results. (You can not use any code from anywhere.)
2. Prepare an assignment report showing extracted clusters for at least 3 values of each parameter.
3. In the report, write a discussion about how the parameters effect the results.
4. In the report, give a technique to automatically decide on the parameters of DB-Dcan?
